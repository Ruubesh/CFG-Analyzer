# Thesis
## Description

Developed as a Master's thesis project, this application is a user-friendly tool built with Python 3.9 and Tkinter, providing a straightforward interface for editing, transforming, and analyzing context-free grammars (CFGs). Users can seamlessly load grammar files, edit specifications, and perform various transformations, such as reducing grammars and removing epsilon rules. Notably, the tool offers step-by-step explanations of transformation processes, enhancing usability and transparency. Whether utilized by students delving into formal languages, educators teaching these concepts, or enthusiasts exploring grammar manipulation, this application serves as a lightweight and accessible platform for learning and experimentation.


## Installation

To use the application, you need to have Python installed on your system. The recommended version is Python 3.9 or above. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

The application does not require any additional packages or dependencies beyond the standard Python library.


## Running the Application

Once Python is installed on your system, you can run the application using the command line interface.

On Windows, open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the application files are located. Then, use the following command:

python app.py

On Linux, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the application files are located. Then, use the following command:

python3 app.py

After executing the appropriate command, the application will launch, and you can start using it to edit, transform and analyze grammar files.

You can find example grammar files in the "grammar files" folder within the CFGAnalyzer.zip file. These example files can be used to explore the features and functionality of the application.
